description: End-of-session reflection - update docs and handovers
---
Reflect on what was learned and accomplished in this session:

1. **Session summary**:
   - Briefly summarize what was accomplished this session

2. **Handover files** (if the project has a handovers directory):
   - Update existing handover files if you made progress on that work
   - List everything you tried and why it failed if the work is still ongoing/unresolved, keep it short and spot on
   - Remove handover files for work that is now complete
   - Only create a NEW handover if there's complex incomplete work that would be hard to continue without context (rare - maybe 1 in 20 sessions)

3. **Learn from mistakes**:
	- If you struggled, made multiple failed attempts, or hit unexpected bugs, identify the root cause
	- Distill this into a brief lesson: what assumption was wrong? What should you check first next time?
	- If the user got frustrated, distill why and how this can be avoided in the future
	- Add to AGENTS.md or context files if the lesson would have saved significant time/effort or improved the outcome had you known it at session start
	- Keep it brief: one line per lesson is fine

4. **Agent documentation** (AGENTS.md and auto-loaded context files):
   - Review all context files that were loaded at session start - can any be improved based on this session?
   - Update if there's a new learning, convention, gotcha, or pattern that should apply across all future sessions
   - Examples: "always check X before Y", "this codebase does Z differently", "avoid approach W because..."
   - Be conservative - keep it focused

5. **Reference files** (loaded on demand, usually in docs/agents/reference):
   - Check if you learned something new about a topic for which there is a reference file, and if yes improve the reference file with your new knowledge.

Summarize what you're updating and why. If nothing needs updating, say so.

**Do NOT commit or push changes. Just report what you updated.**

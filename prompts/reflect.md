description: End-of-session reflection - update docs and handovers
---
Reflect on what was learned and accomplished in this session:

1. **Session summary**:
   - Briefly summarize what was accomplished this session

2. **Handover files** (if the project has a handovers directory):
   - Update existing handover files if you made progress on that work
   - Remove handover files for work that is now complete
   - Only create a NEW handover if there's complex incomplete work that would be hard to continue without context (rare - maybe 1 in 20 sessions)

3. **Learn from mistakes**:
   - If you struggled, made multiple failed attempts, or hit unexpected bugs, identify the root cause
   - Distill this into a brief lesson: what assumption was wrong? What should you check first next time?
   - Add to AGENTS.md if it's a project-specific pattern, or mention it in your summary so the user can decide

4. **AGENTS.md**:
   - Update if there's a new convention, gotcha, or pattern that should apply across all future sessions
   - Examples: "always check X before Y", "this codebase does Z differently", "avoid approach W because..."
   - Be conservative - keep it focused

Summarize what you're updating and why. If nothing needs updating, say so.

**Do NOT commit or push changes. Just report what you updated.**

description: Weigh session discussion and propose 3 solutions with pros and cons
---
Weigh everything discussed in this session and propose potential ways forward:

1. **Summarize the problem/decision**:
   - What are we trying to solve or decide?
   - What constraints or requirements have been mentioned?
   - What approaches have we already discussed or ruled out?

2. **Propose 3 solutions/approaches**:
   For each option, provide:
   - **Name**: Brief descriptive title
   - **Description**: How it works in 2-3 sentences
   - **Pros**: Key advantages (bullet points)
   - **Cons**: Key disadvantages or risks (bullet points)
   - **Effort**: Low / Medium / High

3. **Recommendation**:
   - Which option would you recommend and why?
   - Or if it depends on factors only the user knows, state what those factors are

Keep it concise. Focus on the trade-offs that actually matter for this specific decision.
